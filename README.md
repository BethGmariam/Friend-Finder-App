# Friend-Finder-App
compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application similar to match makers/dating app.

There are ten (10) questions that user needs to answer. Each answer should be on a scale of 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.

The app displays the best match based on the minimum score difference; it then displays the name and an image that describes them. The result will be displayed on a modal popup.
